# Modern JS from the beginning
Small projects built during [Brad Traversy's Modern Javascript from the Beginning course](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/). I used this course to brush up my JS skills and practice ES6/ES7 features.

## Projects
* [Task list](../master/projects/task-list) - DOM manipulation and local storage.
* [Loan calculator](../master/projects/loan-calculator) - DOM manipulation.
* [Book list](../master/projects/book-list) - OOP using function constructors / prototypes.
* [Regex form](../master/projects/regex-form) - Simple form with 3 examples of custom regular expressions validation.
* [Chuck Norris joke generator](../master/projects/joke-generator) - fetch and display Chuck Norris jokes from the [ICNDB JSON API](http://www.icndb.com/api/) using XMLHttpRequest. 
* [EasyHTTP library](../master/projects/easyhttp-library) - custom wrapper library for CRUD HTTP requests. Different versions with XMLHttpRequest, fetch API, promises and async/await.
* [GitHub finder](../master/projects/github-finder) - fetch and display a GH user's profile and repos from the [GitHub REST API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) using fetch, async/await and promises.
* [Tracalorie](../master/projects/tracalorie) - full CRUD app using Module pattern and ES6 syntax.

I didn't limit myself to simply coding along, instead I adjusted, optimised or fixed where I saw fit.
